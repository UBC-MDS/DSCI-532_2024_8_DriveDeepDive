# DSCI-532 Drive Deep Dive Dashboard

## Summary:
The following project is a dashboard representing US based sales from eBay of used vehicles. Our dashboard serves as a deep dive into the used car market across the united states - and has been produced to help both dealerships and private sellers make decisions about pricing and inventory in order to promote successful business practices. The dashboard has segmented the eBay used car data by brand, model, body-style, milleage, and price - it also allows users to get a glimpse into the geographical distribution of vehicles across various states through the use of spatial modelling. Given the immense backlog on cars as a result of the COVID-19 virus, we hope that we can make it easier for entrepreneurs to get their hands on KPI's and insights about their dynamic market, and make sound business decisions based off of our metrics.
