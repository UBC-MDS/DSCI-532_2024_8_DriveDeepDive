# DSCI-532 Drive Deep Dive Dashboard

## üöò About the Dashboard

In the vibrant market of pre-owned vehicles, making informed decisions is key for both buyers and sellers. Our interactive dashboard serves as a beacon for navigating through the complexities of used car transactions across the United States. Whether you are in the business of selling cars, a prospective buyer, or a data enthusiast, our dashboard provides rich insights into sales trends, pricing, and much more.

The motivation behind this project stems from the need to understand the used car market dynamics at a glance. We solve the problem of scattered information by centralizing transaction data into a user-friendly visual interface, highlighting critical market trends and enabling data-driven decision-making.

## üìä Summary

Our project unfurls as a comprehensive dashboard detailing used vehicle sales from eBay within the US. Designed as a navigational tool through the American pre-owned car landscape, this dashboard is crafted to empower both dealerships and private sellers with data-driven insights for strategic pricing and inventory management, bolstering successful business outcomes. Enriched with data segmentation by brand, model, body style, mileage, and price, the platform further provides a window into the geographical spread of vehicles via spatial analysis. Amidst the supply chain challenges wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic, our goal is to streamline access to key performance indicators and market intelligence, aiding entrepreneurs in making informed decisions within a dynamic environment.
