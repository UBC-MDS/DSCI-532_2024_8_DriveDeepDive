### Persona

- Name: Ali Wilson
- Age: 45
- Occupation: Used Car Dealership Owner
- Background: Ali is a mid-sized used car dealership owner in the Oregon. The used car market was impacted a lot during the COVID-19 - the price and stock varied a lot ever since the breakout of the pandamic. Thus, Ali seeks to optimize his inventory and sale price to meet local demand and maximize profits. Ali is tech-savvy and frequently uses digital tools to inform business strategies.

### User Story

Ali wants to refine the dealership's inventory acquisition strategy and pricing strategy to catch market demands and enhance its profitability. Based on some previous researches, Ali aims to understand regional preferences of car makes, models, and body styles compared to national trends. He also seeks to optimize the vehicle pricing based on the conditions of the car itself including mileage, year, and the price trend in local market. With these two information at hand, Ali can then adjust his inventory to focus on vehicles with higher demand and turnover rates.

The market data is everywhere, but Ali found it hard to put the data from different sources together and have a complete view of data at the quick look. Fortunately, Ali found the data dashboard we developed.

When Ali logs into the dashboard, he is greeted with an interactive map showing sales data by ZIP code, allowing him to pinpoint regional trends. Ali is able to use filters to compare the popularity and pricing of different car makes and models within his region or nationwide. He compares average prices for vehicles of similar make, model, year, and mileage in Oregon against the other states to identify opportunities to make profits. He identifies which car categories (economy, mid-range, luxury) are selling fastest in Oregon, using the 'Price Range' feature to segment the data. By using our dashboard, Ali notices a trend that mid-range SUVs are particularly popular in Oregon but are priced higher than the average price of neighbor states. This insight prompts an adjustment in his inventory acquisition and pricing stretagy.

Based on the insights gained from our dashboard, Ali decides to increase the inventory of mid-range SUVs and adjust his pricing strategy to align with national averages while remaining competitive locally. He also plans to reduce the stock of slow-moving vehicle types, optimizing the inventory to meet regional demand and improve sales turnover.
