## Motivation and Purpose (Alan)

### OUR ROLE: Data Science Consultancy Firm (Core Practices in Small Businesses Consulting and Environmental Awareness)

### TARGET AUDDIENCE: Car Dealerships in the United States and Private Sellers/Entrepreneurs.

The aftermath left by the COVID-19 pandemic the sale of new cars was extremely impacted, resulting in a reduction of supply given the global supply chain slow down. The used car market as a result became extremely competitive, and to this day pricing vehicles accurately and understanding market trends by locations is crucial to the success of deal with 2nd had cars. Deals and private sellers often struggle to understand how to price their vehicles and know where the best geographically market is to maximize their returns and supply cars to customers in need.   
  
To address this, we are proposing a dashboard that analyzes the used car sales data from eBay, out dashboard will provide insights into trends relating to pricing, demand, and sale of cars by geography, and breakdowns of what cars are sought after by make, model, and type (SUV, Sedan, Coupe, etc.). Through identifying these patterns and KPI that may help understand which areas of the United States demand certain vehicles – we can help private sellers be more informed on decisions related to pricing and organizing their inventory and product offering. Ultimately, we hope our dashboard lead to helping sellers succeed in optimizing their operations and satisfying more customers in need of 2nd hand vehicles through understanding the dynamics of the 2nd hard car market. We hope this tool assists dealers and potential entrepreneurs to identifying potential gaps in the market and possible investment opportunities – as well as promote the practice of consuming second-hand cars to reduce the strain on the market and environment!
